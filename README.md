## 🧠 Key Engineering Challenges Solved

- **State Persistence & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Integrated `langgraph.checkpoint.postgres` to persist the full `AgentState` at every node transition. Long-running research tasks survive backend restarts, and the architecture supports future HITL breakpoints where a user can approve the Analyst's generated code before it executes.

- **Infinite Loop Prevention:** Implemented a `revision_count` counter in the shared state. If the Critic fails the output 3 consecutive times, the graph forces a transition to the Compiler regardless — preventing infinite agent debates and runaway API costs.

- **Secure Code Execution:** Replaced a local `PythonREPL` with the **E2B Code Interpreter SDK**. The Analyst Agent's generated Python runs in an isolated, ephemeral cloud sandbox — no generated code ever touches the host infrastructure.

- **Real-Time Observability via SSE:** Implemented Server-Sent Events in FastAPI to stream each agent's internal output (search queries, code, critic verdicts) to the Streamlit UI in real-time as the graph executes, rather than blocking until the final answer.

- **Structured Critic Output:** The Critic Agent is prompted to return strict JSON (`{"verdict": "pass/fail", "feedback": "..."}`) parsed with LangChain's `JsonOutputParser`. This makes the routing logic deterministic and prevents the graph from misrouting due to freeform LLM text.

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys in .env
```

Required keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — get at https://tavily.com
- `E2B_API_KEY` — get at https://e2b.dev

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:8501 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### 3. Run locally (without Docker)

```bash
# Backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

> For local runs without Docker, set `DATABASE_URL` to your local PostgreSQL instance or leave it empty to run without state persistence.

## 🔭 Observability & Tracing

Multi-agent systems are notoriously difficult to debug. This project is instrumented with **LangSmith** to trace every LLM call, tool execution, and state transition across the graph.

The backend also returns lightweight run metadata directly in `/analyze` and `/analyze/stream` responses:

- `quality_score` — heuristic 0-1 signal for source coverage, analysis output, critic verdict, and chart generation.
- `sources` — de-duplicated URLs extracted from researcher output.
- `run_metrics` — timestamps, search rounds, revision count, source count, and chart availability.
- `warnings` — non-fatal issues such as missing executable analysis code or sandbox execution errors.

The Streamlit Research Agent sidebar includes visible controls for:

- Research depth: `quick`, `standard`, or `deep`.
- Report style: `executive`, `technical`, or `bullet`.
- Chart generation toggle.
- Maximum number of sources to surface.

Set these in your `.env` to enable tracing:

```bash
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=autoanalyst-ai
```

What you get:
- **Trace Graph** — visualize the exact path the Supervisor took to route the query and how many Critic revision loops occurred
- **Token Analytics** — monitor token consumption per agent to identify bottlenecks (e.g., if the Researcher is consuming 80% of the context window)
- **Latency Tracking** — measure end-to-end graph execution time and individual node latencies
- **Tool Call Inspection** — see every Tavily search query issued and the raw results returned
